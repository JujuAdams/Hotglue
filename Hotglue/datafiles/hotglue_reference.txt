The automation JSON is a way of describing steps to modify a GameMaker project. The root of the JSON is an array and each element of that array must be a struct. Each struct is an instruction. Instructions are executed in the order that they appear in the JSON.



## Simple import example ##

[
    { "destination": ""C:/Users/Juju/Documents/GameMakerStudio2/exampleDest/exampleDest.yyp" }
    { "import": "https://github.com/JujuAdams/Scribble/releases/download/9.7.1/scribble_9_7_1.yymps" }
]

This automation JSON will open a project, download version 9.7.1 of Scribble from GitHub, and then import it into the targeted project.



## destination ##

{ "destination": "C:/Users/Juju/Documents/GameMakerStudio2/exampleDest/exampleDest.yyp" }

This instruction sets the current destination project. Subsequent operations will affect this project.



## clearCache ##

{ "clearCache": true }

Clears all caches. This is helpful if you want guarantee a fresh download.



## itchApiKey ##

{ "itchApiKey": "abcd1234" }

Sets your personal itch.io personal API key which is required for downloading itch.io files.



## suppressGitAssert ##

{ "suppressGitAssert": true }

Toggles Hotglue's Git safety check. This is helpful if you're using source control other than Git (or the safety check throws a false positive).



## deleteLibrary ##

{ "deleteLibrary": "Scribble" }

Deletes the so-named library from the project. This library must have been added by Hotglue in the past.



## import ##

{ "import": "C:/Users/Juju/Documents/GameMakerStudio2/exampleSrc/exampleSrc.yyp" }


This is the main import instruction. It will import content from the target project file. You may specify a .yyp, a .yyz, or a .yymps to import from. You may also specify a file hosted on the internet (e.g. from GitHub) but it must be a direct link to a file.

This instruction has some optional parameters:

{
	"import": "...",
	"subfolder": "Libraries",
	"assets": [
		"resource:objExample",
		"included:external_file.txt",
	],
	"packageName": "Custom Package Name",
	"packageVersion": "1.0.0",
}

The `.subfolder` is a folder that the assets will be imported to in the destination project. This is helpful to keep libraries organized in your project.

The `.assets` variable must be an array of PIDs (Project IDentifiers) found in the source that you'd like to import. If `.assets` is used, all assets that are not named will be ignored. You may not specify assets to import with `.assets` if the source is a .yymps (if the source is a .yymps then all assets will be imported).

`.packageName` can be set to treat the imported files as being part of a package even if the source wasn't a .yymps file. `.packageVersion` can be set to record what version the imported files are from.
